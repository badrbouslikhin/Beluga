3D Printable Mounts and Boxes
=========================

Here are some boxes and holders for Espruino that you can print.

They are in [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) format which means that they can be easily tweaked to different sizes.

STL files can be generated by running `make` in this directory. 

gcode files can be generated by saving a slic3r configuration as `slicer.ini` 
in this directory and then running `make gcode`

**BEWARE:** These have been designed on a 3D printer that is not totally calibrated, and as such could do with some adjustment before printing. Please feel free to contribute back your changes and designs.
